# NHS Healthcare Data Science Project

This project is an independent data science exploration using synthetic healthcare data. The goal was to simulate a real-world healthcare analytics scenario, from designing a database to applying machine learning for insight generation.

##  Project Overview

The healthcare sector generates vast amounts of data across appointments, prescriptions, tests, surgeries, insurance claims, and more. This project focuses on integrating and analysing that data to support smarter decision-making in a healthcare context.

Key tasks:
- Database normalization and schema design
- SQL-based data extraction and transformation
- Statistical and machine learning analyses
- Visualisation and interpretation of insights

---

##  Goals

- Design a fully normalised relational database to model NHS-like healthcare operations
- Identify trends in hospital usage among young patients
- Predict insurance claim reimbursements using regression
- Segment patients using clustering to inform targeted outreach

---

##  Tech Stack

- **Languages**: Python, SQL
- **Tools**: SQLite, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn
- **Notebook**: Jupyter Notebook (fully reproducible)
- **Database**: SQLite (`.sqlite` file included)

##  Key Features

- Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram design (Chen's notation)
- Third Normal Form (3NF) normalization process
- SQL schema creation and data ingestion
- Three machine learning models:
  - Inferential statistics (chi-square test)
  - Supervised regression (insurance claim prediction)
  - Unsupervised clustering (patient segmentation)
- Interactive visualisations and summaries

---

##  Results 

- Identified hospitals with statistically high concentrations of younger patients
- Built a regression model predicting claim approvals with 71% accuracy (RÂ²)
- Segmented patients into 4 groups by demographic and preference profiles
